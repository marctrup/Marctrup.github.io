            <h2>Marc Trup Curriculum Vitae</h2>
            <p> Over the course of my career, I have successfully transformed ideas into successful businesses. This journey has involved building and leading teams, securing funding, and strategically exiting businesses before moving on to the next idea. 
                Through these experiences, I have developed a profound appreciation for the valuable contributions of individuals, teams, and stakeholders who have played critical roles in these successes. 
                Currently, my focus has shifted towards Artificial Intelligence, recognizing the vast potential it holds. I am dedicating my time and further education to exploring the opportunities that AI presents.</p>
