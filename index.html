            <h2>Marc Trup Curriculum Vitae</h2>
                    <P>I have a rich history of founding and building successful businesses across various industries. My journey began at the age of 25 when, 
                        armed with a dental qualification, I identified a market gap and founded the first-of-its-kind mobile dental service offering on-site dentistry to corporate clients 
                        saving them thousands of lost man hours a year in dental visits. This groundbreaking venture revolutionized the dental industry and the idea of dentistry in the workplace. 
                        The business was ultimately acquired by Bupa in 1998, marking its success and impact on the niche. 


                    </P>

                    <P>Foreseeing the growth potential of technology and the internet, I ventured into the EdTech sector. I raised venture capital and established Redbus CPD, 
                        a streaming technology business that provided web based interactive video education for professionals, initially focusing on dentistry. 
                        This venture showcased my ability to foresee industry trends and capitalize on emerging opportunities. The business ultimately transitioned to new leadership through a management buyout.
                    </P>

                    <P>Having also built a property portfolio, I leveraged my experience in property management recognizing the issues around connection and communication between 
                        stakeholders and seeing the possibilities offered by smartphone technology. I ventured into the PropTech sector and founded Arthur Online, a platform and comprehensive suite of apps designed to streamline property management. 
                        The success of Arthur Online led to its acquisition by Advent International and Aareal Bank in 2021.
                        
                    </P>

                    <p>Currently, I run a family office with a strategic focus on AI and machine learning, acknowledging these technologies as pivotal to future advancements.
                         My passion for innovation and commitment to staying at the forefront of technological development have driven my success throughout my career. 
                          I am actively seeking a Non-Executive Director (NED). With a proven track record of business acumen, strategic thinking, and a keen understanding of emerging trends,
                           I bring a wealth of experience to any organization poised for growth and innovation. 
                        My vision for the future is rooted in the transformative power of technology, and I am eager to contribute to early-stage or transformative businesses.
                    </p>
